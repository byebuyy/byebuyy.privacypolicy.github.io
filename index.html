</li>
<p>Byebuyy is always reaching out to a wider audience by showcasing the best of our user’s contributions. However, in doing so, we will not allow to be uploaded, published or posted anything on the Website that, in our discretion, we think could be potentially endangering or inflammatory or embarrassing to our Users. The following are pointers to be kept in mind by users in the interests of their safety online and on the Platform : </p>
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;">
    <p style="margin-right: 10px;">a.</p>
    <p>All Users are responsible for the safety of their personal information.

<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;">
    <p style="margin-right: 10px;">b.</p>
    <p>All Users need to be aware that if they upload their photos on the Platform, the photos are not only visible to the entire internet community but can also be downloaded, since any image that can be displayed on a computer screen can be saved by the person viewing it. It is technically not possible to prevent this and hence Byebuyy cannot be held liable in such cases. If you are worried about someone else viewing or saving your images then please do not submit them.
    </p>
</div>
<div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;">
    <p style="margin-right: 10px;">c.</p>
